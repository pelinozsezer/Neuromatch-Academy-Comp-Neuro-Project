# :sparkles: Neuromatch Computational Neuroscience Course Project:sparkles:

This is the code that I and my colleagues ([Yagmur](https://github.com/zyagmuraydemir), [Oyku](https://github.com/oyku98), & [Zeynep](https://github.com/zeynekilincer)) used for our project during Neuromatch Academy Computational Neuroscience course 2022. We employed [DEAP dataset](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/) and decoded the subject ratings of valence from EEG data using convolutional neural network (CNN).

### **Project Abstract:**

**Decoding The Subjective Ratings of Valence From EEG Activation Evoked by Emotional Visual Stimuli**

The field of affective computing focuses on the development of systems capable of
understanding human emotions and on understanding how the brain computes emotional
information. One of the main goals in the field is to decode human emotions from various data
types. The prominent understanding of sentiment suggests that emotions can not be separated
strictly because they can be experienced simultaneously or in more complex forms. Thus the
correlation between valence, arousal, and EEG data could be viewed as a spectrum rather than
strict classifications.
The multidimensional perspective in affective neuroscience assumes that emotions can be
mapped onto specific positions in the multi-dimensional emotion space. The circumplex model
of the affect model describes valence and arousal (V-A) as the main dimensions of this
multidimensional model. In accordance with the multidimensional perspective and V-A model, it
is hypothesized that human emotions can be decoded from electrophysiological data based on
the V-A space of the model. For this purpose, we will use a decoding technique where the main
components are EEG activation and subjective valence ratings. In other words, we will attempt
to use a decoding method to infer valence levels from EEG activation. We will employ the data
of 32 subjects from the DEAP dataset. The data were collected using 32-channel EEG from
subjects who watched music videos as emotional visual stimuli.
